### 4. Enable Gmail App Password

> You must enable **2-Step Verification** on your Gmail account first.

#### Steps:

1. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Step Verification**
3. Navigate to **App Passwords**
4. Select:

   - App: `Mail`
   - Device: `Other` (e.g., Python Script)

5. Click **Generate** and copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

---

### 5. Edit Script Variables

Open `send_emails.py` and update:

```python
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
app_password = "your_generated_app_password"
subject = "Your Subject Here"
```

---

### 6. Create or Modify `email_body.txt`

Write your email content with `{{name}}` for personalization:

```
Dear {{name}},

This is a sample message sent using Python automation.
Best regards,
Your Name
```

---

### 7. Create or Modify `contacts.csv`

Example CSV format:

```
FirstName,LastName,EmailAddress,CcEmails
Sudeep,B,sudeep@gmail.com,"cc1@example.com,cc2@example.com"
Amithesh,Sharavanan,amithesh@gmail.com,""
```

---

### 8. Run the Script

```bash
python send_emails.py
```

Expected Output:

```
Sent to Sudeep <sudeep@gmail.com>
Sent to Amithesh <amithesh@gmail.com>
```

---

## Script Overview

The script:

- Reads `contacts.csv`
- Loads `email_body.txt`
- Replaces `{{name}}` with first name
- Sends emails via Gmail SMTP with CC support

---

## Important Notes

- Gmail's free tier has a daily email sending limit (\~500/day)
- Use App Password, not your main Gmail password
- Start testing with only your own email addresses
- Don't push `.env`, password, or secret files to GitHub
