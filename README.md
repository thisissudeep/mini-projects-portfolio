# **Mini Projects Portfolio**

Welcome to my Mini Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of small but impactful projects I completed during my learning phase. Each project demonstrates my growth and understanding of various concepts in programming and technology.


## **Purpose**
This repository serves as:
- A resource for others to explore and learn from.
- A reference for future projects and applications.




## **Projects**

1. #### **[Object Detector](projects/object-detector)**

- A tool for detecting and classifying objects in live video streams using OpenCV.

2. #### **[Object Dimensions Analyzer](projects/object-dimension-analyzer)**

- A utility to measure and analyze the height and width of objects in real-time video.

3. #### **[Human-Object Interaction Tracker](projects/human-object-interaction-tracker)**

- A project that identifies and tracks interactions between humans and objects in live video feeds and send the output to firebase.

4. #### **[OCR Processor](projects/ocr-processor)**

- A system to extract and process text from images and documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
