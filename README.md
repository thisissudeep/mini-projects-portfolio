# Mini Projects Portfolio

Hi!! I'm Sudeep. This repository contains a curated collection of mini-projects showcasing my practical explorations in **AI**, **Computer Vision**, **Automation**, and **Speech Processing**. Each project reflects hands-on learning and implementation of real-world problems.

## Projects

### [Crypto Safety Bot](./crypto-safety-bot)

- A Telegram bot that detects fraudulent crypto transactions using AI and lets users cancel them from within the chat.
- Built using `Python`, `Telegram Bot API`, and `AI models`.

### [Face Recognition System](./face-recognition)

- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV.
- Recognizes known faces and flags unknown individuals using Haar Cascade + LBPH.

### [Gmail Automation](./gmail-automation)

- Automates Gmail operation like sending emails using the Gmail API.
- Ideal for productivity automation tasks.

### [Hand Raise Counter](./hand-raise-counter)

- Detects and counts hand raises in real-time video using computer vision techniques.
- Useful for meeting or classroom scenarios.

### [Landmark Recognition](./landmark-recognition)

- Identifies landmarks from images using machine learning.
- Done for educational purposes.

### [OCR Processor](./ocr-processor)

- Extracts text from live video and images, enhances it using Gemini AI, and stores it in Firebase.
- Supports both PyTesseract and Keras OCR.

### [Transcripter](./transcripter)

- Real-time speech-to-text converter using `SpeechRecognition` and Google Web Speech API.
- Captures audio via mic and prints transcribed output.
